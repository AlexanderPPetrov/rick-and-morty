# Rick and Morty App
We need you to create a simple web app to show the Rick and Morty characters with this open graphql endpoint https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

Requirements:
A readme to run the app
We recommend you to use the following frameworks: react, yarn, antdesign, jest

Nice to have:
Extra points for a simple installation, typescript and test coverage.

We donâ€™t have a time limit. You can solve it at your pace.

|------------------------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Responsive layout with antd  | done           | it detects initially device via react-device-detect.<br/> If you test have that in mind.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Characters Listing           | done           | I've started initially with an old fashion pagination, but decided to load more upon scroll.<br/> It's not yet the best solution as we are not destroying components that are not in the visible area and it can lead to a poor performance being at the bottom of the list. Also did not had the time to implement scroll to top button. |
| Characters Filter and Search | partially done | not all available filters are covered, also did not have time to add reset filters functionality                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Character Details page       | done           | You have to click on the eye icon within the actions in character card to test it                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| Simple installation | partially done | Did not have the time to setup Docker container, maybe it was part of the requirement                                  |
| Refactoring         | partially done | Did not have the time to go over on some of the components e.g CharacterDetailsItem.tsx                                |

4. [react-query](https://react-query.tanstack.com/) - used for networking as it's agnostic to protocol (REST or GraphQL)
5. [graphql-code-generator](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) - used to generate types, queries and mutations for direct usage in react components
6. [react-device-detect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-device-detect) - Used for conditional rendering for desktop/mobile

### `yarn install`

Install all dependencies

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
Currently codegen is executed upon start as a precaution so people don't endup with missing files

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
