# Rick and Morty App
We need you to create a simple web app to show the Rick and Morty characters with this open graphql endpoint https://rickandmortyapi.com/graphql

Requirements:
A readme to run the app
We recommend you to use the following frameworks: react, yarn, antdesign, jest

Nice to have:
Extra points for a simple installation, typescript and test coverage.

We don’t have a time limit. You can solve it at your pace.

# TODO list

1. Add and configure all tools required: react, typescript, eslint, jest, ant design, tailwind for utility (ant design has poor coverage), network client (graphql), graphql code gen  - done
2. Create proper project structure - done
3. Update readme file - in progress
4. Examine endpoint to understand what exactly components are needed - in progress
5. Implement responsive design with the required UI framework - in progress
6. Prepare routing setup
7. Create paginated listing with corresponding loading
8. Prepare test suites
9. Optional: full test coverage, load on scroll
10. pre commit hook - lint & test
11. i18n translation pack
12. add alternative icon pack (ant design icons has poor coverage)
13. Remote config - enable/disable features
14. Switch to vite instead of webpack for faster development
15. Add docker
16. Add sentry.io or firebase crashlytics and performance
17. Make the app universal (SSR + SPA) - next or gatsby
18. Make the app PWA
19. Support dark and light theme
20. Improve accessibility (ARIA)
21. RTL/LTR support













# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
